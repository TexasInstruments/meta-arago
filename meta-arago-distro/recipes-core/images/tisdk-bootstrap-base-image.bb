SUMMARY = "Arago TI SDK bootstrap base image for initramfs"

DESCRIPTION = "Image meant for basic system verification of linux kernel.\
 Intended as basic test system, this image does not package the kernel\
 in the standard /boot folder in rootfs. Instead, it provides a base\
 rootfs with enough basic board bringup utilities allowing kernel to be\
 deployed elsewhere (tftp/separate boot partition/jtag log etc..) and\
 maybe used for basic platform bringup (bootstrap) activities.\
