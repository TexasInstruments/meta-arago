Subject: [PATCH] omap: fix omap_bo_size for tiled buffers

The buffer size is calculated using pixels, not bytes as it should. The
result is often correct, though, as the stride is aligned to page size,
but there are still many cases where the size ends up being wrong.

Fix this by not calculating the size at all, as in that case
DRM_OMAP_GEM_INFO ioctl is used to get the correct size from the kernel.
This is better in any case as then the userspace library doesn't need to
know how the tiled buffers need to be aligned.
